<h2>Welcome to 	UARC</h2>
<p> UARC is a facility located within the Kellog Center where they conduct research, testing, training and consulting in accessibility compliance, usability evaluation, and user-centered design, participating in usability and accessibility communities of practice around the world. It serves industry, academic, and government clients, as well as MSU faculty, students, and organizations. UARC staff develop grant proposals and conduct studies on interface design, development and implementation, and introduce innovations in theory, research methodology, and technology. </p>

<h3> My Work with UARC </h3> 
<p> I am currently a User Experience Intern at UARC. Next semester I will be evaluating, testing, and learning all of the industry standards that help create a more accessible world for everyone. I'm looking forward to learning essential skills that will help me in both web design and general usability design, as well as gaining valuable real world skills! We work on a large variety of projects at UARC so everyday is something unique and different.</p>
