<h2> Study Setup </h2>
<p> This study was conducted to see how participants would arrange the information of a new website that has yet to be designed, and that is not being designed by a professional designer. I created a series of topics, categories, and pages that could each be used on a personal website that showcases my works and show who I am. The topics that I created vary in their contents greatly, and at this point don't have nearly the structure that a well maintained and designed website should have. Using card sorting we will be able to see how people react when being forced to sort information that does not have much of a data structure.</p> 
<h2> Results </h2>
        <table border="0"> 
            <tr>
                <td> Participant 1 </td>
                <td>The first participant that tried to sort out the cards had trouble figuring out what to pair with what. They didn't know what many of the things were on the cards, and they could not identify much of an information structure with what was currently present. They ended up matching topics that I would never personally think to match. On the flip side of that, participant 1 was able to create structures that I would not think of, but that still made sense after reviewing them..</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Participant 2</td>
                <td>The Second participant that attempted to make sense of the chaotic cards in front of them struggled just as much as participant 1. While they arranged the cards very differently from the first participant, they struggled to find connections between cards, and struggled to put them in the order in which I would normally put them in. The topics and pages that they arranged together had very little to do with each other, and often complete opposites were paired together.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Participant 3</td>
                <td>The Third participant in the study was able to somewhat organize the information that I gave him. He understood what the topics and pages were much better than the other participants and was able to group similar things together. The main thing that participant 3 struggled with was finding categories that the groups of pages and topics fit into. Participant 3 said that everal of the pages and topics could fit under multiple categories. Overall though, participant 3 was at least able to group things into similarities.</td>
            </tr>
